Hey, guys,

I developed this basic project for those interested in learning the basics about Spring Webflux.

How to execute this project? It's very simple.

Run the docker-compose.yml file to create the database. You need to have a docker installed on your machine.
Then, run the application on port 8080.

This project contains all tests on all layers, resources, services and repository, including integration tests. Everything with mokito.

Wait for new implementations
